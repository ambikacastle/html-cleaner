So it’s no surprise the City by the Bay has developed increasingly close ties to its peninsular brethren. When the Bay Area hosts the 50th Super Bowl in February, the celebration will span the entire region—from the city proper’s 49 square miles (OK, 46.9, but go Niners!) to the team’s new home in Santa Clara, an hour’s drive south. Completed in 2014, Levi’s Stadium is staffed by a group of techies who rove the stands to help guests use the Wi-Fi and a custom stadium app. They’re called NiNerds, natch. <span class="E--SC-WIRED">—Sara Breselor</span></p>
